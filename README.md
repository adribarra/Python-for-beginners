# Python-for-beginners
🤖 Final Project: MIOTI Python for Beginners
Finished in September 2025

## Summary

In this project I used all the knowledge I learned from the 9 modules of the Python for Beginners course from MIOTI by realizing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
For this, I used Kaggle (kaggle.com), which is is the world's largest data science community where you can find a wide variety of datasets ready to be downloaded and analyzed. 

## Instructions

1. Create an account in Kaggle
2. Explore the available datasets
3. Download a dataset with enough data to analyze
4. Do the EDA
   · Import data
   · Clean data if needed
   · EDA: identify patterns and tendencies with different types of graphs
   · Use Matplotlib to create clear and significative visualizations to show the results
